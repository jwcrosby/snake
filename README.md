## Intro

In the not-so-distant future, an elderly and weary Snake lives a solitary life on a remote outpost near the Mexican border. But when he receives a desperate call from an old friend, his plan to hide from the outside world gets upended. Although he is reluctant to embrace violence again, Snake sets out to face the demons of his past on his most thrilling and dangerous mission yet.
